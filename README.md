# SmartAxis

This repository hosts the SmartAxis frontend, initialized with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and React using TypeScript.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Preview the production build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

Static assets (including the custom domain configuration) live in the `public/` directory. The main entry point is `src/main.tsx`, and the landing content is defined in `src/App.tsx`.
